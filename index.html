        <p>David was ridiculed for his exuberance as he rejoiced
          with dancing at the Ark of the Covenant's return home.
          He refused, however, to be deterred by such criticism.
          The ark's return was a reason for celebration. His God
          was the only true and living God. His God had given him
          victory after victory from dangerous foes. His God has
          preserved His people through all sorts of hardships and
          difficulties over a long history of challenges, oppression,
          wandering, and battling. David was determined he would and
          delighted he could celebrate before the Lord.
